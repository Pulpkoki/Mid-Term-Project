# Mid-Term-Project
# Members: Costanza
# Type: Modelling. We will build a regression model that fits best our data, taking advantage of measures of accuracies by creating the training and test data. 
# Background: From Kaggle, we obtained the dataset containing audio statistics of the top 2000 tracks on Spotify from 2000-2019, which includes 18 variables.
# Objective: The scope of our model is to define the factors determining the popularity of a song by evaluating the major songs played on Spotify during a specific timeframe.
#Â The data set consists of information on around 2000 songs that were deemed as Top songs on Spotify between 2000 and 2019. As we want to predict how popular can a song be, we will define the popularity as our dependent variable (Y). 
# In order to explore the data we will use different techniques that we have learned in class, such as the describe method, checking null values, using different libraries to develop model visualization. As the data set has both categorical and numerical values, we will first explore the different variables and then proceed with the data cleaning and pre-processing.
